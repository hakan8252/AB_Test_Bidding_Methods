# AB_Test_Bidding_Methods
Comparison of Bidding Methods of Facebook using AB Test

# 1-) Business Problem

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'averagebidding', as an alternative to the existing bidding type called 'maximumbidding'. One of our clients, decided to test this new feature and would like to run an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding. The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and client is now waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for client is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.
